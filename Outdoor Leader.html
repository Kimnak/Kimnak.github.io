                                    <p class="card-text"> A person being an Outdoor Leader means a lot of loving and
                                        taking responsibility for the care of nature, appreciate the beauties of the
                                        creatures, wildlife, and the green of the world. It also means leading and
                                        supervising your peers and yourself to be a leader of an Outdoor, and have a
                                        deep understanding of nature. Nature indicates lots of dedication to me;
                                        appreciated with love, enroll of nature’s needs, protect, and fill nature with
                                        our kindness as their assistance of life. Beforehand, I lived in the province of
                                        Kampong Chhnang, which is full of beautiful mountains and forests that need our
                                        help. Of course, at that time I didn’t even know what nature meant to me, and I
                                        didn’t care much and was oblivious to those problems that had happened to
                                        nature. Fortunately, I am inclined to experience the wildlife which I got to
                                        explore different beautiful species of nature that held it by “Liger Leadership
                                        Academy”; on a project called Outdoor Leadership Exploration, which motivated me
                                        to inspire other Cambodian students.

                                        Talking about Cambodian Youth Outdoor Leadership Program is a program that had
                                        been given to me by “Liger Leadership Academy”. The ambition of this program is
                                        to empower Cambodian youth to be outdoor leaders and environmental stewards by
                                        introducing them to natural spaces, raising awareness of conservation threats,
                                        and nurturing the passion and skills needed to positively impact their
                                        communities.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To create the impact for Cambodian youth, our group program had been working
                                        very hard together and came up with the idea of creating the workshop for
                                        Cambodian youth plus an outdoor trip in a goal to let them explore more about
                                        nature and having experience of visualizing the beauty of nature as they are our
                                        participants. In this case, we act in an important role as facilitators to
                                        facilitate them through different skills and techniques that they needed to be
                                        an Outdoor Leader.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Having the participants attend our workshop, we have reviewed our past lessons
                                        and skills that we have learned from our facilitators, and finalized with four
                                        skills: Leadership and Community-Building, Medical and Risk Management, Nature
                                        Appreciation and Wilderness Skills. We initiated those four skills to allow our
                                        participants to learn basic skills of being outdoors, and what are needed while
                                        outdoors. These four skills have three different facilitators that will
                                        facilitate the participants as I am facilitating the participants in what
                                        Leadership and Community-building is. Out of these processes, I have learned and
                                        improved on many skills. I learned how to create good lessons for teaching or
                                        facilitating on different lessons, and be organized on my plan. Moreover, I
                                        learned the different perspectives of leaders, and the different types of
                                        leadership styles that I could apply in different circumstances.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Improving my skills is very essential, but my impact is more important for this
                                        Outdoor Program. I could create an impact for a multitude of Cambodian Youth to
                                        change their perspective of nature and to spread the word of appreciating the
                                        importance of nature.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To see the potential impact for this program, we all as Cambodians should
                                        consider the consequence of destroying nature, and take the impact from this
                                        program to be spread to your friends, family, and communities to start standing
                                        out of their fear and raising awareness of the environmental and nature problem;
                                        by being a good model of showing your love, and your appreciation to nature for
                                        creating a brighter future our green Cambodia.
                                    </p>
